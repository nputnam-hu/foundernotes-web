I.

I’m going to start this essay from 2 quotes from two dimatrecally opposed figures in the history of economics:

“Capitalism is nothing but a class struggle between the proletariat (labor) and the capitalists (capital). The proletariat must overcome this in order for man to be liberated”

“I don’t trust the baker by the kindness of their heart, but their own incentives”

The first quote is from Karl Marx and I think it really epitomizes the psychically destructive nature of capitalism. Capitalism helps and yet intrudes, like a neighbor that slips through your side door to leave a box of cookies on your bedside table. Yes your life is technically better off, but there is still something viscerally disturbing about the whole affair.

In Marx’s conception of society, the neighbor is the capitalist class and the house is the lives of the labor class. Capitalists give cheap food, quality entertainment, and technology marvels like search engines and automobiles. But in exchange Laborers must surrender much of their freedom. Most obviously in terms of labor itself, as society only becomes accessible by selling your 60% of your time to some capitalistic enterprise. But capitalism metastizes far deeper than that. Your attention is no longer soverign as units of it can be chopped up and auctioned by Google and CBS. Your heroes no longer just prosper but also try to sell you things. Land is no longer natural landscape, but is now low-density-zoned exclusive beach-front property.

The second is quote is from Adam Smith and I think it epitomizes the best properties that capitalism offers. Capitalism structures incentives in order allow for a large number of actors to coordinate. In doing so, capitalism actually grants freedom. Freedom from starvation as it lowers food prices. Freedom from the cold by incentivising the invention of affordable insulation. Freedom from

I think a lot of how I structure my life is explained by the fact that I hold both of these arguments as true.

II.

- Entrepreneurship is not economically rational
  - Lower salary
  - Worse employability
- But what that misses is that entrepreneurship has a huge psychic return
- In a Capitalistic society, starting a company is a transcendental act. For a fleeting moment the labor-capital dichotomy totally sublimates. The labor is the capital. The capital is the labor.
- When Steve Jobs proclaimed "I am apple" this is what he was alluding to. Or as Jay-Z rapped, "I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man!" That lines demonstrates how for Carter, entrepreneurship allowed him to transcend the oppression of laboring. You're selling your time to yourself. Youre creating capital assets that you own
- Now that recedes as the company grows and is partially sold. But it never goes away, as long as you own a singficant part especially of the voting shares
- Iiberating and makes you better, see: founder-led companies outperform
- Also frees you from the ennui of being a capitalist and not being able to build something with your hands
- In this world-view the only rational choice is entrepreneurship

III.

- Now this only works as an individual solution, not systemic
- And there are a lot of contradictions
- But WALT Whitman quote, OG transcendalist
- Do I condradict myself? Very well, I contradict myself. I am many, I contain multitudes.
